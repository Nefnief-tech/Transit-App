# TransitFlow AI

An AI-powered daily driver for public transport navigation in Metro Vancouver (Canada) and Germany/Europe. TransitFlow AI focuses on simplicity, reliability, and enhanced user experience through predictive analytics, natural language queries, and optimized routing.

## Overview

TransitFlow AI is designed to be the go-to tool for commuters, tourists, and eco-conscious travelers seeking efficient, low-emission transportation options. The app supports multi-modal transport (buses, trains, trams, ferries, subways) across regions with seamless location switching.

### Regions Covered
- **Metro Vancouver**: TransLink systems including SkyTrain, SeaBus, and buses
- **Germany/Europe**: Deutsche Bahn trains, regional buses/trams, and cross-border routes to neighboring countries (France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria)

### Target Users
- Daily commuters
- Tourists
- Eco-conscious travelers

### Platform
- Mobile-first (iOS/Android)
- Web version for broader access

## Key Features

### Core Features
- Real-time tracking of vehicles and arrivals
- Route planning with multi-modal options (e.g., bus + train)
- Offline maps and schedules for reliability
- Fare estimation and payment integration
- Accessibility options (wheelchair-friendly routes)
- User accounts for saved favorites and history

### AI-Enhanced Features
- **Predictive Delays**: Machine learning forecasts based on historical data, weather, and traffic
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-analyzed user patterns for optimal routes and eco-friendly options
- **Natural Language Interface**: Chatbot for queries like "What's the fastest way from Vancouver Airport to downtown at 5 PM?"
- **Crowd Density Prediction**: Estimate bus/train crowding using historical and real-time data
- **Dynamic Re-routing**: Real-time alternative suggestions during disruptions
- **Sustainability Insights**: Carbon footprint calculation per route with greener alternatives

- GraphQL for efficient queries

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated builds

## Data Sources

### Metro Vancouver (TransLink)
- TransLink Open API: Real-time bus positions, arrivals, alerts
- GTFS Static Data: Schedules, routes, stops
- GTFS Realtime: Live vehicle positions and trip updates

### Germany (Deutsche Bahn and Regional)
- DB Transport REST API: Timetables, real-time departures/arrivals
- DB Fahrplan API: Schedules and routes
- RIS::Stations API: Stop-place data
- Verbundkarte Collection: Regional transport data

### Wider Europe
- European Transport Feeds: Comprehensive GTFS/NeTEx feeds
- Lyko Public Transit API: Aggregated data from 300+ European operators
- National Access Points (NAPs): EU-mandated country-specific portals

### Supplementary Data
- Weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap) for delay predictions
- Historical archives for AI model training
- Anonymized user-generated data (with consent)
